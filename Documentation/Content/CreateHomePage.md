# Create a Home Page
Upon installing Cosmos, creating a home page is the last step in the process of setting up Cosmos for the first time. You can also create new home pages later on as well. The following descibes how to do so.

## First Home Page
When Cosmos is installed it contains no web pages, and when you open the "Editor" automatically you will be taken to the "Page List."

Here you will see no pages listed. There is a button at the top that says "Create Page." Click on this and follow the dialog.

Tip: If you selected a ready-made layout during install, chances are that layout contains a "home page" template. Select that as your first page then edit it to suit your needs.

## Web App as your Home Page
You may want to have a web app built using Angular, jQuery, React, Vue, Google Map, Map Box, or ESRI Map as your home page.

For any of these instances Cosmos "pages" can then be used for documentation for users regarding your app. Examples include instructions on how to use the application, or, how to read the map, or where to get more information.

Cosmos pages could also host other applications that compliment the one on your home page.

If you are choosing this pattern for your Cosmos site.
